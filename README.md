In this assignment, you are required to design a system for a supermarket using Spring Boot. Frontend development is not mandatory but will be considered a plus. The system should allow customers to register, sign up, and purchase items. The inventory keeper should be able to add items to the inventory and receive orders placed by customers. Once the inventory keeper prepares the order, a delivery person will pick it up and deliver it to the customer. The customer should be able to track the progress of their order.

For the first part of the assignment, you need to provide a report about the system and its design, which is worth 30 marks. The report should cover the following points:

Justify the selected architecture for the system and explain why it is suitable.
